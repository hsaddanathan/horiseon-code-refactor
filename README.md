# horiseon-code-refactor

## Summary

The Horiseon Website that was shared with our class displayed elements that would not be considered semantic elements. Replacing these elements allows for people and machines to read and understand the code thoroughly. 

In addition, when parsing through the code, Alt tags were not included on images. This presents a problem with regards to SEO and, more importantly, accessibility. Companies must be vigilant with ensuring that Digital Assets have Alt Tags to explain what the Asset is depicting, because there are many users who use screen readers.

With regards to classes assigned to different elements, there was a lot of redundancy with the classification of elements. I was able to consolidate classes, which in turn, cleaned up the amount of CSS needed.
